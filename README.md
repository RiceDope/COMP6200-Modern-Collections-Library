# ModernCollections

A modern collections library for java. Developed as part of my dissertation at the uni of Kent. 

## Working on

Tasks that are currently being worked on will appear here.

- Fully test all features
- Insert method

## Backlog

Tasks will appear here if they are needed but cannot be worked on immediately.

- List wanted functionality
- Test coverage
- Potentially swap to using Enums for "confined functionality" Enforce sort ascending/descending. Or enforcing queue or stack. Will enable easier development and tidy up the amount of boolean flags used.

## Constant

Tasks that will require constant additions will appear here.

- Build tests

## Completed

Full history of tasks that were noted down and have been completed.

- Research proposal Draft
- Framework in place for removal of null elements
- Switch to Maven
- Implement JUnit
- Basic ArrayList functionality
- Some structure in place for future optimisation
- ArrayList clear operation
- Create basic Queue
- ArrayList append (If enforceSort active then insert correctly)
- ArrayList sort operation (Overwrites current with new)

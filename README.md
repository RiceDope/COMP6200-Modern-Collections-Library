The collections library being developed

## contactsapplication
A sample program using a sequence in order to store contacts

## benchmarking
Benchmarking of the collections library using JMH

## benchmarkanalysis

# Plan

- Conceptualise the design
- Make slides describing the implementation and design (Also explaining choices)
- Learn about long term strategies
- Look at old projects that could be sample projects:
    - Encryption Year 2 (Security)
    - League table Year 2 (Algorithms)
- Showcase how to use the Collections
- Continue benchmarking

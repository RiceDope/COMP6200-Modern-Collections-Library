For the class to act as a Queue it must have the following functionality
- Queue
- Dequeue
- Peek
Inheritance from java.util.Collection: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html

Memory management plan for ArrayList and Queue:

- A queue will be removed from index 0 and added at index i.
- An arrayList has random access and any item can be removed and then added to and from.
- Cannot shift all items down if index[0] is removed each time in a queue. Only makes.
- Two pointers could exist to show a start and an end of the "list"
- When end pointer reaches the same length as the list. All terms are shifted down the relevant amount of spaces 
  (In relation to what has been removed). And the size of the array grows by 1.5x? Pointers for beginning and end are moved to
  new positions relative to the new beginning and end.
